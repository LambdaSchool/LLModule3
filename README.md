These tasks are to be completed during the project time for your track. For full time these tasks will be completed in the afternoons after lunch. For part time these tasks are completed every other day, on the opposite days of the guided project instruction.

On Friday afternoons many tracks are having students do presentations of their projects or builds for the week on Zoom. We want you to have the opportunity to be able to view these presentations to get an idea of what you will be working on.

## What's Your Why?
> "If you can imagine it, you can create it. If you can dream it, you can become it" - William Arthur Ward


Really dig deep and fully explain your "Why?" of starting Lambda School. Imagine what your future will look like.  This can take any format that will be useful to you in the future:
 
- A vision board with posterboard, magazine cutouts and words written in marker
- A written letter from your "future self" to your "present self" about how your life is different now that you completed Lambda school. 
- An electronic document with written details and pictures done in Pinterest, Trello, Notion, etc.
- A website or blog entry
